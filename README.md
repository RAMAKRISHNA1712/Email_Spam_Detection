# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to detect spam emails using natural language processing techniques. The model classifies emails as either **spam** (unwanted or malicious emails) or **ham** (legitimate emails).

## Project Overview

Email spam detection is a key application of text classification. Traditional rule-based filters are limited in adaptability. Machine learning allows systems to learn from data, detect patterns, and classify emails accurately.

## Dataset

Popular datasets for spam detection:

* SpamAssassin Public Corpus
* Enron-Spam Dataset
* SMS Spam Collection Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

The project uses a labeled dataset with spam and ham email samples.

## Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is essential to prepare the data for modeling. Steps include:

* Removing punctuation, stopwords, and HTML tags
* Converting text to lowercase
* Tokenization and normalization (stemming or lemmatization)
* Vectorizing the text using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF

## Feature Engineering

Additional features that can improve classification accuracy:

* Presence of URLs or special characters
* Number of capital letters or numeric characters
* Frequency of spam-related keywords

## Models Used

Machine learning models used for classification:

* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest

Advanced models like Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformers (e.g., BERT) can be used for better performance in large-scale applications.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify spam and ham emails.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAMAKRISHNA1712/Email_Spam_Detection/
cd Email Spam Detection UI
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model and test spam detection:

```bash
python app.py
```

Ensure that the dataset is available in the correct directory and properly formatted before running the script.

## Deployment

The model can be deployed as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI, or integrated into an email processing system for real-time spam filtering.

## Challenges

* Handling image-based or obfuscated spam
* Working with imbalanced datasets
* Ensuring real-time performance in production
* Maintaining privacy when analyzing user emails

## Future Work

* Implement deep learning models like LSTM or BERT
* Build a web-based interface for email classification
* Add multilingual spam detection
* Integrate with email clients for live filtering
